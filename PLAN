# PLAN

**Tic Tac Toe**
*Player configuration*
Make a tic tac toe game in which you you give 2 players as the arguments.
Then make a function to start the game.
First thing it does is get the name for each player.
Then it gets game marker from the player making sure its not a number, and its one character.
It also makes sure the marker is not the same as the other players.
After the player selection is done it shows the board which is numbered 1-9. It uses user input based on the board, and does so for each player until a player wins or all the spots on the board are filled.

*Board checker*
The board is check ever move to see if someone has won.
It calls a function which checks for 3 consecutive marks diagonally
and vertically. It does so by mode(diagonal, horizontal, vertical) and then checks for the marks, if there are 3 of the same marks it returns the marker otherwise it returns nil.

*Game loop*
The game is played in a loop. It checks if the game is won or tied.
If it is it breaks the loop, otherwise it continues the game by getting the current player choice, changing between both.

**Player class**
Creates a new player object with an attr_accessor for name and marker.
